In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we developed a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app using **Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s dataset**. In particular, this project delved into the dataset of FEMA's funded projects (financial obligation to grantee) under the Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) grant programs.
 See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**:
+ In the face of unpredictable disasters, from pandemics like COVID-19 to natural calamities like hurricanes, preparedness is paramount. With New York City as a focal point, this project delves into the Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) Projects dataset, which chronicles the diverse disaster risk reduction projects financed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA's objective is not just reactive but proactive – funding projects that diminish potential losses and safeguard lives and assets from upcoming threats.

+ The dataset offers a detailed breakdown: from the nature of the disaster and its specific location, to the overall project costs and the extent of federal funding granted. By analyzing this dataset, the project seeks to:
  
+ Our interactive Shiny app serves a dual purpose:
For citizens: It equips them with knowledge to preemptively prepare for and react to potential disasters.
For the government: It provides insights and data-driven recommendations on disaster preparedness, ensuring that funds are adequately and wisely set aside for future mitigation initiatives.

Project 2 group 7

Team members: Zhaolin Wang, Yoojin Lee, Bessie Wang, Yitian Shen

Summary: In this project, we utilize the Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) Projects dataset from FEMA to design a Shiny app. This app assists American residents in disaster preparedness and offers insights for the government on future fund allocation and disaster response strategies.
